# Task ID: 3
# Title: Explore ESPN API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Explore and document the ESPN API endpoints for NCAA Men's College Basketball to understand the data structure and available endpoints.
# Details:
Create a Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ directory to explore the ESPN API endpoints. Document the following:

1. Base URL: http://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/basketball/leagues/mens-college-basketball
2. Key endpoints to explore:
   - /seasons: List of available seasons
   - /seasons/{year}/types: Season types (regular, postseason)
   - /seasons/{year}/types/{type}/weeks: Weeks within a season type
   - /scoreboard: Current scoreboard data
   - /scoreboard?dates={YYYYMMDD}: Scoreboard for specific date
   - /summary?event={eventId}: Detailed event summary
   - /teams: Team information
   - /teams/{teamId}: Specific team details
   - /teams/{teamId}/roster: Team roster

3. Document the response structure for each endpoint, focusing on:
   - Primary keys and identifiers
   - Nested data structures
   - $ref links that need to be followed
   - Pagination mechanisms if present

4. Create sample requests and save example responses for testing purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all key endpoints are accessible and document any rate limiting or access issues. Ensure that the response structures are well-documented for implementation.
