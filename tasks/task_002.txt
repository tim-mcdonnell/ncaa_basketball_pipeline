# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the development environment with all required dependencies and configurations.
# Details:
1. Create a virtual environment for the project
2. Install all dependencies specified in pyproject.toml
3. Configure dagster.yaml with appropriate settings
4. Set up .env file with required environment variables for local development
5. Configure DuckDB connection settings

Example pyproject.toml content:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=42", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "ncaa_basketball_pipeline"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "NCAA Basketball Data Pipeline - Bronze Layer with Dagster and dlt"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "dagster",
    "dagster-webserver",
    "dagster-dlt",
    "dlt",
    "duckdb",
    "pandas",
    "requests",
    "python-dotenv",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest",
    "black",
    "isort",
    "mypy",
    "jupyter",
]
```

Example .env file:
```
# DuckDB Configuration
DESTINATION__DUCKDB__CREDENTIALS__DATABASE="ncaa_basketball.duckdb"

# ESPN API Configuration
SOURCES__ESPN_API_SOURCE__BASE_URL="https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/mens-college-basketball"
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the virtual environment is created successfully and all dependencies are installed. Test that Dagster can be started and that the DuckDB connection works.
