# Task ID: 13
# Title: Define Dagster DLT Resource
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Dagster DLT resource definition for integrating dlt with Dagster.
# Details:
Create the definitions.py file in the dagster_bronze_layer directory to define the Dagster DLT resource:

```python
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster_embedded_elt.dlt import DagsterDltResource

from .assets import espn_bronze_assets_definition, espn_bronze_partitioned_assets_definition

dlt_resource = DagsterDltResource()

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[espn_bronze_assets_definition, espn_bronze_partitioned_assets_definition],
    resources={
        "dlt_resource": dlt_resource,
    }
)
```

This defines a DagsterDltResource that will be used by the assets to run dlt pipelines. The resource is added to the Dagster Definitions object along with the assets that will use it.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the Dagster DLT resource is correctly defined and can be loaded by Dagster. Test that it can be accessed from asset definitions.
