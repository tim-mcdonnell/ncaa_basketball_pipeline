# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Event Details Resource
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the ESPN API source with a resource for fetching detailed event information.
# Details:
Add a new resource to the espn_ncaa_basketball_source for fetching detailed event information:

```python
@dlt.resource(
    primary_key=["id"],
    write_disposition="merge"
)
def event_details(event_id: str):
    """Fetch detailed information for a specific event"""
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/summary?event={event_id}")
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

Then update the source function to include this resource:

```python
# Return all resources
return {
    "seasons": seasons,
    "season_types": season_types,
    "weeks": weeks,
    "events": events,
    "event_competitors": event_competitors,
    "teams": teams,
    "event_details": event_details,
    # Add more resources
}
```

Implement logic to handle $ref links in the API responses, which may require additional requests to fetch referenced data.

# Test Strategy:
Test the event_details resource with mock API responses. Verify that it correctly handles the response structure and extracts all relevant information.
