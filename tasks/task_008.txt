# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Play-by-Play Resource
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the ESPN API source with a resource for fetching play-by-play data for games.
# Details:
Add a new resource to the espn_ncaa_basketball_source for fetching play-by-play data:

```python
@dlt.resource(
    primary_key=["id", "event_id"],
    write_disposition="merge"
)
def plays(event_id: str):
    """Fetch play-by-play data for a specific event"""
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/playbyplay?event={event_id}")
    response.raise_for_status()
    plays_data = response.json().get("plays", [])
    for play in plays_data:
        play["event_id"] = event_id
    return plays_data
```

Then update the source function to include this resource:

```python
# Return all resources
return {
    "seasons": seasons,
    "season_types": season_types,
    "weeks": weeks,
    "events": events,
    "event_competitors": event_competitors,
    "teams": teams,
    "event_details": event_details,
    "team_details": team_details,
    "team_roster": team_roster,
    "team_statistics": team_statistics,
    "player_statistics": player_statistics,
    "plays": plays,
    # Add more resources
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Test the plays resource with mock API responses. Verify that it correctly extracts and structures the play-by-play data.
