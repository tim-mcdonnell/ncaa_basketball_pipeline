# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Integration Tests for Dagster Assets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Create integration tests for the Dagster assets to ensure they correctly materialize data into the bronze layer.
# Details:
Create integration tests for the Dagster assets in the tests/ncaa_basketball_pipeline directory:

```python
# tests/ncaa_basketball_pipeline/test_assets.py
import pytest
import os
import sys
import duckdb
from dagster import build_init_resource_context, materialize
from unittest.mock import patch

# Add the project root to the Python path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../..')))

from ncaa_basketball_pipeline.ncaa_basketball_pipeline.assets import espn_bronze_assets_definition
from ncaa_basketball_pipeline.ncaa_basketball_pipeline.definitions import dlt_resource

# Setup and teardown for a test DuckDB database
@pytest.fixture
def test_duckdb_path():
    # Use a temporary path for the test database
    path = "test_ncaa_basketball.duckdb"
    yield path
    # Clean up after the test
    if os.path.exists(path):
        os.remove(path)

# Mock the dlt source to return controlled test data
@pytest.fixture
def mock_dlt_source():
    with patch('ncaa_basketball_pipeline.dlt_sources.espn_api_source.espn_ncaa_basketball_source') as mock:
        # Configure the mock to return test data
        # This would typically involve setting up mock resources that return test data
        yield mock

# Test that the assets can be materialized
def test_espn_bronze_assets_materialization(test_duckdb_path, mock_dlt_source):
    # Set the DuckDB path for the test
    os.environ["DESTINATION__DUCKDB__CREDENTIALS__DATABASE"] = test_duckdb_path
    
    # Initialize the dlt resource
    init_context = build_init_resource_context()
    resource_instance = dlt_resource.initialize(init_context)
    
    # Materialize the assets
    result = materialize(
        [espn_bronze_assets_definition],
        resources={"dlt_resource": resource_instance}
    )
    
    # Verify that the materialization was successful
    assert result.success
    
    # Verify that data was loaded into the bronze schema
    conn = duckdb.connect(test_duckdb_path)
    # Check that the bronze schema exists
    schemas = conn.execute("SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata").fetchall()
    assert ('bronze',) in schemas
    
    # Check that expected tables exist in the bronze schema
    tables = conn.execute(
        "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'bronze'"
    ).fetchall()
    expected_tables = ['seasons', 'events', 'teams']  # Add more as needed
    for table in expected_tables:
        assert (table,) in tables
    
    # Clean up
    conn.close()
```

This test verifies that the Dagster assets can be materialized successfully and that they create the expected tables in the bronze schema of the DuckDB database.

# Test Strategy:
Run the integration tests with pytest to verify that the Dagster assets correctly materialize data into the bronze layer of the DuckDB database.
